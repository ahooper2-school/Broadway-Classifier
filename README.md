# Broadway-Classifier

[Repository for the Broadway Image Classifier project](https://sites.google.com/view/broadwayclassifier/home)

This project was developed as part of the **UW CSEP 590C Spring 2020 - Full Stack Deep Learning** course.

The purpose of this project is to develop and train a model to classify audience photos of Broadway Theaters. This repo contains scripts used to download all Broadway Theater photos from [ViewFromMySeat.com,](https://aviewfrommyseat.com/), Jupyter notebooks for developing models, and a web application to deploy the model using a Google Cloud Function backend.

In shipping this application, we've gained experience developing a machine learning project end-to-end, while realizing the vital importance of strong datasets in training models.
