Learnings:

1. Keras can handle all the data preprocessing we will ever need, so our only job is to grab the raw data.
2. ImageGenerator loops indefinitely unless the steps per epoch are specified in model.fit_generator.
3. Out of memory exceptions? Restart the kernel.
4. Loss of NaN while training? Need to decrease image size and batch size.
